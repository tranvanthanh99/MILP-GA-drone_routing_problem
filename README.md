# MILP-GA-drone_routing_problem

## Running the program

### Genetic algorithm

```bash
python drone_GA1.py [population-size] [number-of-iterations] 
```

Required params:

1. ```[population-size]``` is an integer positive number that specifies the number of individuals of each generation in the genetic algorithm;
2. ```[number-of-iterations]``` is an integer positive number that specifies the number of iterations (population generations) of the genetic algorithm.

### MILP

```bash
python drone_MILP.py
```
